SPIRIT MEAL & DAILY DEVOTIONAL - 26 January 2026\n\nTHE HOUSE OF PHILIP\n\nText: Acts 21:8-10; Joshua 24:15; Isaiah 8:18\n\nBrethren, our families are our first gifts unto the Lord. And, as we know, God is very gift-sensitive, as well as sacrifice-selective. We must bring unto him the very best as masterfully inspected and approved by the Holy Spirit. \n\nMay the hand of our God be so more than ever evident and in manifestation in our homes, in Jesus name. And, may no family member become the weak link through which the enemy comes in and wreak havoc in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. \n\nWhen we give our whole family unto the Lord, it is the best we could give. He is a rewarder and will not despise whole family offering. A family set apart unto the Lord is big confusion to the enemy. Joshua declared,\n\n “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” Joshua 24:15.\n\nNow, Philip had four daughters who prophesied. His home was a stopover house for missionaries to check-in, refresh, and get set for the next mission.\n\n We shall look more into this man’s home from tomorrow and learn a few lessons for today’s Christian homes. When the whole family is engaged in ministering services unto the Lord, what a mighty blessing and glory it yields. \n\nMay we not fail in this regard as we go through this life, in Jesus name.\nThis whole week, we shall carefully examine our families and seek the Lord for grace to plug every loop hole through which the enemy comes in to weaken us and render us out of service. \n\nAnd at some points, try to bring us into stigma, reproach, stopping our dance and bringing us to a halt. God forbid.\n\n“Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.” Isaiah 8:18. \n\nBeloved, may your family receive fresh blessings of great testimonies, this whole week, in Jesus name.\n\nGod’s daily promise for today: “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” Exodus 12:13.\n\nDaily Bible Reading: Acts 17",
    prayer: "The battle against family oneness and love is raging higher than has ever been. Pray for families waging internal wars with untold casualties on every side. Pray against infiltration from the enemy.",

    content: "THE LIVING CHRIST GOSPEL MINISTERIES INT'L. SPIRIT MEAL & DAILY DEVOTIONAL - 19 January 2026\n\nI PRAY YOU, DEPART FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED MEN\n\nText: Numbers 16:23-32\n\nBeloved, welcome to a new week in God’s presence. Your blessings shall be blessing of multiplication in the mighty name of Jesus.  \nWe begin with Scriptures as the Lord honours his word in our lives.\n\n“And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. \n\nAnd Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. \n\nBut if the LORD make a new thing and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. \n\nAnd it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.” Numbers 16:23-32.\n\nThe Lord is graciously warning us to steer clear of people who rather not assets to the Kingdom. They are on a lass conveyor belt jerking to destruction. Be warned. ",
    prayer: "Pray for grace to cut off from the Korah generations. “I will not be swept with them. My family will not be caught in their web of unrighteousness.",

SPIRIT MEAL & DAILY DEVOTIONAL - 18 January 2026\n\nTHE LOVE FOR HEAVEN 7\n\n[Why you should not miss Heaven]\n\nText: John 14:3\n\nWhile we should not think that heaven is a place of showing off self-accomplishments, let’s remember that there will be many Overcomers like the Apostles, Prophets and Saints who have gone before. \n\nHowever, the reason you should not miss heaven should be centered on the Lord Jesus, otherwise heaven will be far and inaccessible to you for your heart and motive sake.\n\nAcceptable reasons could include the following:\nJesus’s home and throne\nJesus’s close presence (beholding his face always)\nJesus’ table is there - eat with Him\nServing Jesus as his priest directly\nLiving with those who love Jesus\nEverything about Jesus\n\nThoughts for the day: If Jesus Christ was not in Heaven, would you still have been satisfied with living there?",

Doing so is doable but is a dangerous mismatch. \n\nThe Isaiah verse in the study text opens our eyes to see that the earth produces seed and bread. The farmer [sewer] picks the seed and plants it, while the consumer [eater] picks the bread and eats it.\n\nTHE POWER OF SEED\nSeeds have productive mandate. A seed is endowed to produce multiple other seeds endlessly. All seeds die to produce new life. \n\nTHE BELIEVER’S SEED\nDo not eat your seed. Do not waste your seed. There is a seed in your hand. See it as seed and not bread to be consumed. Money, Time, Prayer, and Love are all seeds you can sow into the Kingdom.",
