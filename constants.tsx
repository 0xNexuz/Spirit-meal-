SPIRIT MEAL & DAILY DEVOTIONAL - 26 January 2026\n\nTHE HOUSE OF PHILIP\n\nText: Acts 21:8-10; Joshua 24:15; Isaiah 8:18\n\nBrethren, our families are our first gifts unto the Lord. And, as we know, God is very gift-sensitive, as well as sacrifice-selective. We must bring unto him the very best as masterfully inspected and approved by the Holy Spirit. \n\nMay the hand of our God be so more than ever evident and in manifestation in our homes, in Jesus name. And, may no family member become the weak link through which the enemy comes in and wreak havoc in the mighty name of Jesus. Amen. \n\nWhen we give our whole family unto the Lord, it is the best we could give. He is a rewarder and will not despise whole family offering. A family set apart unto the Lord is big confusion to the enemy. Joshua declared,\n\n “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.” Joshua 24:15.\n\nNow, Philip had four daughters who prophesied. His home was a stopover house for missionaries to check-in, refresh, and get set for the next mission.\n\n We shall look more into this man’s home from tomorrow and learn a few lessons for today’s Christian homes. When the whole family is engaged in ministering services unto the Lord, what a mighty blessing and glory it yields. \n\nMay we not fail in this regard as we go through this life, in Jesus name.\nThis whole week, we shall carefully examine our families and seek the Lord for grace to plug every loop hole through which the enemy comes in to weaken us and render us out of service. \n\nAnd at some points, try to bring us into stigma, reproach, stopping our dance and bringing us to a halt. God forbid.\n\n“Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Zion.” Isaiah 8:18. \n\nBeloved, may your family receive fresh blessings of great testimonies, this whole week, in Jesus name.\n\nGod’s daily promise for today: “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” Exodus 12:13.\n\nDaily Bible Reading: Acts 17",
    prayer: "The battle against family oneness and love is raging higher than has ever been. Pray for families waging internal wars with untold casualties on every side. Pray against infiltration from the enemy.",

SPIRIT MEAL & DAILY DEVOTIONAL - 19 January 2026\n\nI PRAY YOU, DEPART FROM THE TENTS OF THESE WICKED MEN\n\nText: Numbers 16:23-32\n\nBeloved, welcome to a new week in God’s presence. Your blessings shall be blessing of multiplication in the mighty name of Jesus.  \nWe begin with Scriptures as the Lord honours his word in our lives.\n\n“And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. \n\nAnd Moses said, Hereby ye know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. \n\nBut if the LORD make a new thing and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. \n\nAnd it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation.” Numbers 16:23-32.\n\nThe Lord is graciously warning us to steer clear of people who rather not assets to the Kingdom. They are on a lass conveyor belt jerking to destruction. Be warned. ",

    title: "The Seed and the Bread",
    topic: "Divine Provision",
    memoryVerse: "2 Corinthians 9:1-10",
    content: "SUNDAY SCHOOL LESSON OF TLCGMI \n\nWEEK 47 – WEEK 48\n\nEat your bread; sow your seed. You do not sow your bread; and you do not eat your seed. Doing so is doable but is a dangerous mismatch. \n\nThe Isaiah verse in the study text opens our eyes to see that the earth produces seed and bread. The farmer [sewer] picks the seed and plants it, while the consumer [eater] picks the bread and eats it.\n\nTHE POWER OF SEED\nSeeds have productive mandate. A seed is endowed to produce multiple other seeds endlessly. All seeds die to produce new life. \n\nTHE BELIEVER’S SEED\nDo not eat your seed. Do not waste your seed. There is a seed in your hand. See it as seed and not bread to be consumed. Money, Time, Prayer, and Love are all seeds you can sow into the Kingdom.\n\nIt is God’s pleasure to both give you seed and bread. Both may come in the same bud, yes. Be careful to see seed as seed. You can only plant seed. Do not eat your seed and them go and plant your bread. The earth will not reject the bread you plant but it won’t grow it as seed as the earth is only endowed to grow seeds and not bread. A bucket of corn seed can – produce a basin of akamu; can produce a kilogram of flour; can plant an acre of farm land. So decide what to do with your bucket of corn seed.\n\nTime: Time is one of the greatest seed God can give you. [Ecclesiastes 3:1]. Plant it [1 Chronicles 12:32]. Educate yourself [1 Kings 7:13-14]. \n\nStudy the word of God [2 Timothy 2:15]. Seek to know the ways of God [Jeremiah 9:24 –“ But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.” Use your time to follow God [John 8:12 – “Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.” \n\nMoney:  Money answers to all things. Waste it, you waste life. Yes. A child of God must know that the essence of having money and good money for that matter is to simply sponsor the work of God. Your gold, land, job proceeds, investment returns, family members, etc. are all primarily seeds to be sowed into the fertile vineyard of God’s Kingdom. Know this you live; reject this, you die, the death of Adam who died but was still walking about. “A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.” Ecclesiastes 10:9.\n\nPrayer: Prayer is another seed you sew and may not see it growing as you watch and pray. Prayer works. Prayer moved mountains. Prayer kills. Prayer saves. Prayer travels. Prayer produces wonders. Prayer is God’s system of mobile communication. It can be made anywhere, at any time, for any purpose. It is a weapon of mass destruction [Matthew 26:53 – “Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?”. It is a weapon of mass salvation [Luke 23:34]. \n\nLove: Love is a seed that feeds your enemy dead. Proverbs 25:21 – “If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink: For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.” Love is a deadly weapon as well as a potent medicine. Love (Charity) is greater than faith. And without faith you cannot please God; yet love is greater than faith. 1 Corinthians 13:13. Love is of God. Only children of God can practice love, true love. He that loves id born of God. Read 1 John 4:7-8. [Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.]\n\nTHE BREAD\nYes, bread is good. Bread feeds you today. Bread gives instant satisfaction. It is God that also gives bread to the eater. Isaiah 55:10.\n\nBecome a Seed General today.\n\nSupporting Scripture\n\nLuke 6:38 - [Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.]\n\nPsalms 50:5 – [Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”]\n\nStudy Questions\nWhat does it mean to sow your bread?\nHow do we tell bread from seed?
